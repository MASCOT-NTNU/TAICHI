#Notes for the simulation result in this folder

This simulation result contains the result for the two-agents TAICHI design. The objective of this simulation study is to compare if multiple agent is helping improving the performance of information 
gathering given the same amount of sampling effort and time constraint. 

The result shows that double the agents usually improves the knowledge of the field and thus leading to a more efficient sampling design. 

However, the simulation study does not account for any practical matters such as information exchange in the harsh environment that can cause lagging and missing packages. For more robust studies, a better 
system architecture needs to be proposed and implemented before the field experiment.
